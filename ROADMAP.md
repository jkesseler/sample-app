# Roadmap
- Server side rendering
- [x] Multiple routes
- [x] Route based layouts
- [x] API Proxy to protect API key and endpoints
- [-]Authentication and protected routes. This requires server-side code.
  Could be done with JWT. But the client self should never have full access to
  the token. https://stackoverflow.com/a/47227826

  There is a sub implementation for protected server routes

- Add slots per Layout
- Route based code-splitting
- Add documentation on folder structure, state-management, etc.
- Code coverage reports
- E2E Testing
- Add Storybook or React Styleguidist
